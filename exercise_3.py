#Exercise 3: Area of a Room
#(Solvedâ€”13 Lines)
#Write a program that asks the user to enter the width and length of a room. Once
#the values have been read, your program should compute and display the area of the
#room. The length and the width will be entered as floating point numbers. Include
#units in your prompt and output message; either feet or meters, depending on which
#unit you are more comfortable working with.
